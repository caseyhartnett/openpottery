          <h2>Torrify and the Parametric Pottery Shrinkage Caliper workflow</h2>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              I began learning CAD to fill a gap: simple, custom pottery tools that weren't available on standard repositories like Printables or MakerWorld. I quickly realized that parametric CAD (via OpenSCAD) is uniquely suited for ceramics, particularly for generating tools that automatically adjust for clay shrinkage rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, leveraging modern LLMs to write this code was tedious. The workflow involved constant context switching—copying code, pasting it into a viewer, taking screenshots of errors, and feeding them back to the AI.
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this, I built <a href="https://torrify.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrify</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Torrify is a free, open-source desktop tool that streamlines the design process. It integrates the chat interface directly with a real-time OpenSCAD preview, allowing for a seamless loop of prompting and visualization. It supports "bring-your-own-keys" for privacy and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Parametric Pottery Shrinkage Caliper, available in our <a href="prints.html">3D Prints section</a>, was the pilot project for this workflow. By simply describing the tool and its requirements to the AI, I was able to generate a fully adjustable model without writing a single line of code manually.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other tools created using this workflow include:

            </ul>
            <p>
              For each of these, the process was conversational: discuss the design goals, review the generated 3D model, and iterate. If a shape isn't quite right, Torrify's built-in screenshot tool lets you show the AI exactly what needs fixing.

          <h2>Leaf ceramics with 3D-printed cookie cutters</h2>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              I've been exploring ways to blend digital precision with the organic feel of hand-built 
              ceramics. These recent pieces were created using custom leaf-based cookie cutter sets 
              that allow for a high level of detail while maintaining a consistent silhouette. Each 
              design features a clever two-part system: a sharp outer cutter for the profile and a 
              separate internal stamp to emboss the intricate vein textures.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workflow is efficient but still leaves plenty of room for manual touch. After 
              pressing the initial shape and vein details into the clay slab, I use my standard 
              hand-building tools to clean up the edges, carve deeper into certain areas, and 
              refine the curves until the leaf takes on a more natural, lifelike form. 
            </p>
            <p>
              What I love most about this approach is the scalability. These can be made large 
              enough to serve as the structural base for an entire vessel, or kept small and 
              delicate to serve as decorative accents on larger thrown pieces. It's a great 
              example of how 3D printing can act as a helpful bridge for traditional studio 
              work rather than a replacement.

          <h2>3D printed texture molds: meet Casper</h2>
          <div class="post-content">
            <img src="assets/casper-tile.png" alt="A pottery tile featuring a textured relief of a cat named Casper" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <p>
              One of the most exciting intersections of digital fabrication and clay is the ability 
              to create custom texture molds that capture fine details impossible to achieve by hand. 
              I recently made this relief tile of my cat, Casper, using a 3D printed negative mold—a 
              project that turned out to be a perfect test case for translating photography into 
              tactile ceramic art.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workflow is surprisingly simple. I started with a photo and used a lithophane 
              generator to create a negative mold. I've experimented with a few tools—while 
              <a href="https://itslitho.com/" target="_blank">ItsLitho</a> offers deep control 
              over the depth and settings, I've found the 
              <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab/lithophaneBoard" target="_blank">MakerWorld Lithophane Tool</a> 
              is often the best choice for a quick project. It just works, requiring very little 
              fiddling to get an ideal result for printing.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this tile, I set the depth to around 1/4 inch (5-6mm) and printed the mold 
              in basic PLA on my Bambu A1. From there, the pottery steps begin:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Roll a slab of clay to about 3/8 inch thick.</li>
              <li>Dust the mold with corn starch to ensure an easy release.</li>
              <li>Press the clay firmly into the mold (this may take a few tries to learn the right pressure).</li>
              <li>Trim the excess and carefully pull the tile out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After the tile dried, it went through a standard bisque and glaze firing. I used 
              <strong>Amaco Seaweed</strong> glaze, which is known for how beautifully it 
              "breaks" over sharp textures—pooling in the recessed areas of the fur and 
              thinning on the highlights to create a genuine sense of depth. I'm planning 
              a full series of these portrait tiles, as the same technique works perfectly 
              for everything from custom studio logos to complex abstract patterns.

          <h2>How this platform is organized</h2>
          <p>
            OpenPottery was built to be a central hub for the modern studio, bridging the gap 
            between ancient ceramic traditions and the possibilities of digital fabrication. 
            We've organized our resources into three main categories: archival knowledge, 
            3D-printable assets, and custom software tools. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're browsing public domain manuals in our Texts section, downloading 
            specialized studio jigs from our Prints library, or generating custom slab 
            templates with our web tools, every part of the site is designed to help you 
            experiment with new workflows and work more efficiently.
