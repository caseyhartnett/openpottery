          <h2>3D printed texture molds: meet Casper</h2>
          <div class="post-content">
            <img src="assets/casper-tile.png" alt="A pottery tile featuring a textured relief of a cat named Casper" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <p>
              One of the most exciting intersections of digital fabrication and clay is the ability 
              to create custom texture molds. I recently made this tile of my cat, Casper, 
              using a 3D printed negative mold.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workflow is surprisingly simple. I started with a photo and used a lithophane 
              generator to create a negative mold. I've experimented with a few tools—while 
              <a href="https://itslitho.com/" target="_blank">ItsLitho</a> offers deep control 
              over the depth and settings, I've found the 
              <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab/lithophaneBoard" target="_blank">MakerWorld Lithophane Tool</a> 
              is often the best choice for a quick project. It just works, requiring very little 
              fiddling to get an ideal result for printing.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this tile, I set the depth to around 1/4 inch (5-6mm) and printed the mold 
              in basic PLA on my Bambu A1. From there, the pottery steps begin:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Roll a slab of clay to about 3/8 inch thick.</li>
              <li>Dust the mold with corn starch to ensure an easy release.</li>
              <li>Press the clay firmly into the mold (this may take a few tries to learn the right pressure).</li>
              <li>Trim the excess and carefully pull the tile out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After the tile dried, it went through a bisque and glaze firing. I used 
              <strong>Amaco Seaweed</strong> glaze, which does a great job of breaking over 
              the textures. I'm planning a full series of these, and the same technique 
              works perfectly for custom studio logos or more abstract patterns.

          <h2>How this platform is organized</h2>
          <p>
            From public domain manuals in our Texts section to 3D printable studio 
            jigs, we've organized OpenPottery to support both traditional craft and 
            digital fabrication.
